# Kanji Quizzer

Kanji Quizzer is a web application designed to help users learn JLPT N5 vocabulary through a structured learning system. It features a chunk-based learning approach, review modes, and progress tracking, powered by a modern tech stack.

## 🚀 Technologies

- **Frontend:** React (Vite), React Router, Lucide React
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express), deployed as Vercel Serverless Functions
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Data Collection:** Python (BeautifulSoup) for scraping vocabulary
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## 📂 Project Structure

- `api/`: contains the backend logic and API endpoints.
- `web/`: contains the React frontend application.
- `scraper.py`: Python script to scrape JLPT N5 words from JapanDict.
- `server.js`: Entry point for running the API locally.
- `words.json`: The dataset of vocabulary (generated by the scraper).

## ✨ Features

- **Chunk-based Learning:** Learn words in manageable sets (default: 10 words).
- **Progress Tracking:** Tracks mastered words per user (identified by initials).
- **Review Mode:** Revisit words you have already mastered.
- **Daily Persistence:** Simple login using 3-character initials.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- Python 3.x
- A Supabase project

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
# Install root dependencies (backend)
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd web
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
PORT=3000
```

### 3. Data Generation (Optional)
If you need to regenerate the `words.json` dataset:
```bash
python3 scraper.py
```
This will fetch the latest JLPT N5 list from JapanDict.

### 4. Running Locally

**Start the Backend:**
```bash
npm start
# Server runs on http://localhost:3000
```

**Start the Frontend:**
```bash
cd web
npm run dev
# Frontend runs on http://localhost:5173 (usually)
```

## 📦 Deployment
The project is configured for **Vercel**.
- `vercel.json` handles the routing, directing `/api` requests to the backend and other requests to the frontend.

### 5. Running with Docker 🐳

To run the entire application (frontend + backend) using Docker:

1.  Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.
2.  Make sure your `.env` file is set up with valid Supabase credentials.
3.  Run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

-   **Frontend:** http://localhost:8080
-   **Backend:** http://localhost:3000
